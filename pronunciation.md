# Swedish Pronunciation

[Tape A Audio Here](https://www.livelingua.com/fsi/Swedish/Basic/FSI%20-%20Swedish%20Basic%20Course%20-%20Guide%20to%20Pronunciation%20Tape%20A.mp3)

This chapter is intended especially for the student who is learning Swedish on his or her own. 
The accompanying tape is an integral part of this Unit, and hence must be used in conjunction with the following pages.

We have avoided using phonetic symbols in the book. 
Instead we feel that the combination of the tape and the accompanying brief descriptions of how the sounds are produced will provide an appropriate basis for Swedish pronunciation.

We also hope that the student who studies with a teacher will find both chapter and tape helpful.

We naturally tend to concentrate on those sounds that exist in Swedish and not in English, rather than on sounds that are common to the two languages. 
Spending a little extra time in the beginning to get the Swedish sounds right is better than learning them incorrectly and then trying to compensate later.

Many sounds in the Swedish language are similar to sounds used in English.
A few sounds used in Swedish do not exist in English.
We will be more concerned with sounds than with spelling, although sometimes the latter has to come in.

Let's begin by looking at and listening to the Swedish alphabet, which has 29 letters: 
```
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Å Ä Ö
```
When we discuss Swedish sounds in this chapter we refer to the sounds in this alphabet. 
Remember this order of letters, especially when you are looking up a name in the phone book or a word in a dictionary: Å Ä Ö are last.

## Swedish Vowels
Let's begin by taking a look at and listening to the Swedish vowels. 
Repeat them after the tape:
```
A O U Å
E I Y Ä Ö
```
Learn them in these groups: 

Hard Vowels | Soft Vowels
--- | ---
A O U Å | E I Y Ä Ö

These vowels can be pronounced long or short.
For example listen to the different lengths of the vowel sound in these Swedish word pairs:

Long Vowels | Short Vowels
--- | ---
dag (day) | dagg (dew)
väg (road) | vägg (wall)
vila (to rest) | villa (house)
för (for) | förr (before)

Can you hear the difference in the vowel length? 
When Swedish vowels are long they _very long_.
No matter how much you think you exaggerate their length, they can not be too long.

There are no diphthongs in Swedish. 
If one vowel letter follows another', each one is pronounced separately. 
(This happens in certain English words too, e.g. c_oo_eration, r_ei_terate, etc.)
 All vowel letters are pronounced, there are no silent vowel letters.

Let's learn and practice long-short vowel differences in Swedish words. 
The purpose here is to learn to pronounce Swedish, not to learn to spell and not to learn vocabulary. 
The translation furnished is just for your information. 
Listen to the tape and read the words. 
Close your mind to everything around you and pay close attention to the way the voice on the tape pronounces the words. 
Try to imitate the speaker. 
If you are studying alone, have a mirror handy. 
We'll tell you when you need it.

## Hard Vowels 
```
A O U Å
```

### A

#### Long A
The long A in Swedish resembles the long A in (American) English, e. g. "father," "hard," "barn" (Boston pronunciation discouraged).
Just make it longer.

  - glas (glass)
  - stad (city)
  - dag (day)
  - vad (what)
  - mat (food)
  - ta (to take)
  - tak (roof, ceiling)
  - lat (lazy)
  - ska (will)
  - har (have, has)

#### Short A
The short Swedish A is somewhat similar to the vowel in the English words "cot", "not." 
Listen carefully to the pronunciation of short Swedish A on the tape and repeat after it.

  - glass (ice cream)
  - vatten (water)
  - dagg (dew)
  - kaffe (coffee)
  - matt (weak)
  - han (he)
  - tack (thank you)
  - kan (can)
  - hade (had)
  - hall (hall)

Now we will give you one word with a long A and one with a short A. 
Listen to the differences in the vowel and imitate it.

Long A | Short A
--- | ---
glass | glas
dag | dagg
mat | matt
tak | tack
hal (slippery) | hall
tal (speech) | tall (pine tree)

### O

#### Long O
The long O is close to the English vowel in "troop" and "tomb." 
Here are some words with long O. Try to make them _very long._

  - krona (crown)
  - sol (sun)
  - bo (to live)
  - stor (big)
  - bok (book)
  - fot (foot)
  - bror (brother)
  - god (good)
  - ro (to row)
  - mot (against)

#### Short O
The short Swedish O has the same quality as the long O but it is shorter. 
Listen to the words with a short O and repeat after the tape.

  - hon (she)
  - moster (maternal aunt)
  - ost (cheese)
  - hotell (hotel)
  - ond (evil)
  - bomull (cotton)
  - fort (fast)
  - bonde (farmer)
  - tom (empty)
  - kort (card)

Now we will practice a long and a short O so you can hear and learn the difference.

Long O | Short O
--- | ---
krona | hon
bok | ost
bror | fort
god | tom
ro | kort

### U

#### Long U
The Swedish long U does not exist in English. 
Now you can get out your mirror and use it while you do the following.
Listen to the English word "yew." 
Now say it very slowly and watch what your lips do at the end of it. 
Keep your lips in this position.

Now we'll make a little change, by dropping the "y" and emphasizing the "w":
```
U U U
```
Now we'll practice words with a long U.

  - fru (wife)
  - kul (fun)
  - ut (out)
  - sur (sour)
  - nu (now)
  - mus (mouse)
  - hur (how)
  - tur (luck)
  - hus (house)
  - brun (brown)

#### Short U
The short U sound has a different quality. 
This time you don't need your mirror. 
Say the English word sugar after the tape.
```
sugar sugar sugar
```
If you say it quickly the U will be very close to the Swedish short U. 
Now listen to this Swedish word: `uggla` (owl). 
Now we'll practice some other Swedish words with short U.

  - frukt (fruit)
  - upp (up)
  - brunn (well)
  - lunch (lunch)
  - under (under)
  - buss (bus)
  - luft (air)
  - tunn (thin)
  - rum (room)
  - mun (mouth)

Now we'll say a word with a long U and one with a short U. 
Look in the mirror and see what your mouth does.

Long U | Short U
--- | ---
fru | frukt
brun | brunn
ut | upp
nu | under
hus | buss

### Å

#### Long Å
Long Å is similar to the English vowel sound in "four," "soar," "more," but much longer.
Here are some words with a long Å

  - år (year)
  - måne (moon)
  - stå (to stand)
  - mål (goal)
  - gå (to go)
  - tråd (thread)
  - båt (boat)
  - tåg (train)
  - hål (hole)
  - våt (wet)

#### Short Å
The short Å is very similar to the vowel sound in the English words "song," "long," and "wrong," but shorter.

- gång (time)
- mått (measure)
- lång (long)
- måste (must)
- sång (song)
- ånga (stream)
- hålla (to hold)
- ålder (age)
- många (many)
- ångra (to regret)

Now we'll say one word with the long Å and then one with the short Å.
Listen and try to hear the difference in length.

Long Å | Short Å
--- | ---
gå | gång
år | sång
hål | hålla
måne | många
båt | mått

Remember that the Swedish name of this letter is "Å".


The same sounds, both the Long Å and the short Å sound, are sometimes spelled with an "O". 
The long A sound spelled with an "O" is unusual, but the short A sound spelled with an "O" is rather common.

##### Long Å sound spelled with an "O"
- son (son)
- kol (coal)
- telefon (telephone)
- mikrof**o**n (microphone)

##### Short Å sound spelled with a "O"
- om (if)
- som (who, which)
- kopp (cupp)
- komma (to come)
- kosta (to cost)

The vowels you have just practiced `A O U Å` are the "hard" vowels. 
We will now continue with the other group of vowels, the "soft" vowels.

## Soft Vowels 
```
E I Y Ä Ö
```

### E

#### Long E
Long E is a pure vowel. It is **not** the same as the vowel sounds in "say," "day," "gray," etc. Listen to the tape:
```
E E E E E
```

Now we'll practice the long E sound in some words. Be sure to make it very long.
- se (to see)
- ben (bone, long)
- mer (more)
- sen (late)
- te (tea)
- ren (clean)
- paket (package)
- brev (letter)
- heta (to be called)
- det (it, the)

#### Short E
The short E sound is almost the same as the vowel sound in the English words `rest`, `best`, `rent`, `send`, but shorter.
- en (a, an)
- hem (home)
- fem (five)
- men (but)
- ett (a, an)
- hetta (heat)
- vem (who)
- den (it, the)
- mest (most)
- igen (again)

Now we'll say one word with a long E and one word with a short E

Long E | Short E
--- | ---
det | den
mer | men
ben | en
sen | hem 
heta | hetta

### I
The Swedish `I` is similar to the vowel sounds in the English words `teak`, `seed`, `leave`, etc. Listen
```

```

#### Long I
For the long I be sure to make it **very long**.
- i (in)
- tiga (to be silent)
- vin (wine)
- hit (here)
- fin (fine)
- vila (to rest)
- vis (wise)
- dit (there)
- bil (car)

Listen to the short I sound in same Swedish words and repeat them.

- finn (find!)
- flicka (girl)
- viss (certain)
- min (my, mine)
- tigga (to beg)

Now let's listen to one word with a long I and then one word with a short I.
