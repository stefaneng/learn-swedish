# Preface

FSI Swedish Basic Course developed from a need to provide a more comprehensive and up to date curriculum than had been afforded by an earlier work, Spoken Swedish. 
The latter had been produced during the 1950's by William R. Van Buskirk and Fritz Frauchiger of the FSI linguistic staff, with the assistance of members of the staff of the Post Language Program of the American Embassy in Stockholm.

FSI Swedish Basic Course is intended primarily for use as the foundation for intensive classroom use with a qualified instructor, but it has also been designed so that the student who does not have the benefit of an instructor may use the text and its accompanying tapes with profit.

This book was developed entirely at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington. 
Under the general editorship of Allen I. Weinstein, the text was conceived and executed by the Swedish instructional staff, headed by Ingrid S. Beach and including Margareta Weyl, Margareta Feller, and Anne-Marie Carnemark. 
Illustrations were conceived and drawn by Peter Weyl. 
Layout for the text and the cover design were executed by John McClelland of the FSI Audio-Visual Staff. 
The tape recordings accompanying this text were voiced by Peter Ling-Vannerus, Niklas Lund, Claes Röhl, Ingrid Beach, Anne-Marie Carnemark, and Margareta Weyl, and were made at the FSI studios under the direction of recording engineer Jose Ramirez.

The authors wish to express their gratitude to the Foreign Service Institute students who used the field-test editions of the book in Washington and who contributed many helpful ideas and criticisms. 
A special debt of gratitude is due Marianne L. Adams who, as FSI Publications Officer, provided the initial stimulus for the creation of this book and whose encouragement along the way was of great importance.

## To the Student

Welcome to the world of Sweden, Swedes, and Swedish!

You have obtained this book as a way to help you learn the Swedish language, and to help you prepare for Life and work in Sweden. 
We hope that both these experiences will be enjoyable for you, but before you begin we would Like you to know some facts about language study in general, and this book in particular.


The new *FSI Swedish Basic Course* has been written especially for the future U.S. diplomat in Sweden. 
It is meant to serve as a textbook as well as a source of cultural information and it is accompanied by a complete set of tapes.

We all know that the ability to speak a foreign Language and to live in a new culture is not learned through books and tapes alone. 
These are only aids in a learning process which begins in the classroom, where the instructor is the primary source of information and your main conversation partner, and which later expands to the whole country of Sweden, where a nation becomes your teacher. 
However, the book has taken into account the student who may not have a teacher available. 
It was designed in such away that, together with extensive use of the tapes, it may be used profitably by the self-study student.
A self-study course, however, cannot provide sufficient opportunities to practice speaking and understanding Swedish.

The primary goal of language learning is to communicate with the native speakers in a natural and productive way.
A secondary goal is to learn to read and translate Swedish, since this is an important skill you will need in your work.

The first twelve Units consist of dialogs which cover a range of situations relevant to your life and work in Sweden. 
The last few Units are written in a narrative form and constitute a transition to further reading.

Each Unit includes _Notes on Basic Sentences,_ which clarify certain grammar points, cultural information and idiomatic expressions that we think are particularly important.

Following _Notes on Basic Sentences_ is a section called _Points to Practice._
This section deals with the grammar, which is first explained as clearly and simply as possible, and then put to use in Practices. 
Here you can cover up the correct responses with a piece of heavy paper or cardboard and then slide the paper down the page to confirm the correctness of your response or correct any error you may have made. 
Be sure you do the Practices *aloud*.

Grammatical explanation should be thought of only as a tool when learning a foreign language. 
But it is the key to understanding a structure and a system which might otherwise seem confusing. 
Even though Swedish grammar and vocabulary are related to their English counterparts, a word-by-word translation from either language into the other does not necessarily produce good sense. 
Because of important differences in ways we have of expressing the same thoughts, speakers of English and Swedish see each other as using different patterns of language. 
It is therefore invaluable to learn Swedish patterns to the point where they become a real part of your speech, so that the difference between English and Swedish becomes natural to you.


Over many years of teaching Swedish to English speaking students the teachers at FSI have noted consistent patterns of difficulty that an English speaker has in learning Swedish. 
We have tried to draw on this experience in explaining the grammar and in painting out the pitfalls. 
Our happy Vikings are used to draw attention to some of the grammar points, and to make the task of learning Swedish grammar a little less serious.
A dragon appears in places where we discuss something that may be unusually tricky.

### How to Use the Tapes

The tapes provide the correct pronunciation of the dialogs, narrative texts and grammar practices. 
On the tapes each Unit begins with the dialog _For Listening Only_ to give you the chance to understand as much as possible unaided. 
Remember that it is just as important to understand what is being said as to produce your own sentences. 
Following _For Listening Only_ there is a section called _For Learning_. 
It contains the same dialog, but this time each new word is given with a pause, during which you are to repeat the word before the correct pronunciation is confirmed. 
The same pattern is then used for longer utterances. 
Try to mimic the native speakers as closely as possible, paying elose attention to stress and intonation. 
When an utterance is very long it will, be divided into two or more sentences, and then given in its entirety.

The grammar practices have also been taped, in order for you to hear the pronunciation of the correct response given in the practices. 
We advise that you keep your book open when doing the grammar practices with the tape, since you will always have to read the instructions for each individual practice in order to know which cue words you are supposed to use. 
However, you will find that some practices can be done orally using only the tape. 
In those instances, try to rely on what you hear on the tape and don't look at the book.

Studying a Swedish textbook and Listening to the accompanying tapes does not guarantee mastery of the Swedish Language. 
We hope that this book will serve as one of many aids iu your endeavor and that you will find numerous opportunities to practice your Swedish. 
The best way of doing that is to close your book and put your vocabulary and grammar to use in real situations. 
This is when you have to transfer your book-learning into something productive and meaningful. 
When you speak, understand and read outside the cLassroom environment you have truly learned to communicate in your new language.

Good luck in your Swedish enterprise!

## Till Läraren

Följande är ett förslag tl I I hur Swedish Baslc Course kan användas svenskundervisningen:

### Uttal

Ett utförligt kapItel med medföljande band inleder boken. Läraren bör naturligtvis gå igenom alla vIktiga punkter och hjälpa eleverna att få ett bra uttal från början.

### Dialog

#### Genomgång aV ny läxa

Läraren I äser de nya orden och I åter e I everna upprepa dem I korus. Sedan I äser läraren en mening i taget och låter varje elev upprepa den. Här har läraren ett bra tlll- Uille att rätta och förklara uttalet. Det är väsentligt att vara mycket noggrann
med uttalet i början så att eleverna inte grundlägger dåliga vanor. Vi beräknar att två eller tre sidor per dag är lagom för hemarbete. I början kan det vara fördel- aktigt tör eleverna att lära sig dIalogen utantill så att de automatiskt tIllgodogör sig rytmen, ordföljden och språkmönstret.

#### Förhör av läxa

Nästa dag kan man börja med att låta eleverna gå Igenom dialogen med den svenska texten övertäckt och med den engelska texten som minnesstöd. Man kan sedan låta eleverna ersätta en del ord i dialogen med andra ord som de lärt sig tidigare och öva olika former samtidigt som det grammatiska mönstret bIbehålls. Till sist slår eleverna Igen böckerna och använder dialogen i rollspel. Spontant rollspel passar
inte för aIIa elever. Det kan tör en deI vara svårare att hitta på något att säga än att använda det nya språket korrekt. I sådana ta II är det I ämp 11 gt att använda s.k. "directed dialog," d.v.s. läraren talar om tör eleven på svenska (eller möj-
Iigtvis på engelska) i indirekt form vad han/hon ska säga. Läraren kan också själv ställa frågor tlII eleverna med användande av ordförrådet j texten.

### Grammatik

Läraren går igenom de grammatiska punkter som tas upp I varje kapitel och eleverna arbetar självständigt hemma på övningarna med banden till hjälp. Grammatikavsnitten innehåller ett stort antal övningar i förhoppningen att eleven kan lära sig språkstrukturen genom
att öva den och höra den så mycket som möj \ i gt. För att vara säker på att övn ingarna verkligen görs bör läraren då och då, utan varning, gå igenom dem i klassen.
Efter kapitel 12 har vi frångått formatet med enbart dialog. Kapitel 13-16 utgör en övergång ti I I tidningsläsning. Svårighetsgraden stegras avsevärt 1 dessa stycken.
Texterna kan med fördel användas tl I I läsning, översättning och diskussion. Diskussionen kan till exempel röra sig om olika seder och bruk, olika åsikter, politiska förhållanden, etc. Den kan också göras I ivl igare om läraren eller någon av eleverna intar en impopulär ståndpunkt. Med hjälp av banden kan eleverna också öva upp förmågan att lyssna och förstå.
Kapitel 6 är avsett som ett prov på vad eleven lärt sig i kapitel 1-5. Vi rekommenderar att eIeven deIar upp kapiteI 6 i minst två sekt ioner för att nå bästa möj Iiga resuItat .
Det är lämpligt att då och då under kursen gå ti Ilbaka och repetera och att inte ta
för givet att eleverna har tillgodogjort sig allt som tidigare förekommit i boken eller diskuterats i klassen.
Detta är endast vårt förslag tiII hur Swedish Basic Course kan användas. Vår förhopp- ning är att boken kan inspirera och uppmuntra läraren att använda sin egen fantasi på
ett sätt som bäst passar de individuella eleverna i hans/hennes klass, och även klassens storlek. Låt fantasi och kreativitet komma ti II nytta. Tänk på möj I igheten att använda "propsll och att stimulera undervisningen genom att företa något fysiskt aktivt. ut- flykter, restaurangbesök, simulerad guidning på svenska, etc., kan erbjuda bra tillfällen att använda svenskan I real istiska situationer.
Låt boken vara en hjälp I undervisningen och låt den inte diktera hur undervisningen ska gå tiII. Målet är att lära engelskspråkIga elever att förstå och uttrycka sig på svenska och den metod som når det resu Itatet är den rätta metoden. Lycka t i II !
