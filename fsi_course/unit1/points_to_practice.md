# Unit 1 - Points to Practice
Grammar means different things in different contexts. In this book we use the word to describe the mechanics of the Swedish of the grammar provides the method for sentences. By using real sentences repeatedly you will become familiar with the grammar rules.

In each of the Units there will be some Points to Practice. In working on these you will also acquire vocabulary and learn usefuL Swedish idioms.

## Point 1 - En and Ett
Swedish nouns come in two varieties those for which the indefinite article (English "a" or "an") is EN and those for which it is ETT. Most of the time there is no way of telling the difference. You'll just have to learn which nouns go with which article. The exercises below will help you learn the EN and ETT nouns we've already used.

## Point 2 - Present Tense of Verbs
When do we add `-r`?

The infinitive (basic form of the verb) and the present tense do not have the same form in Swedish.

word form | swedish | english
--- | --- | --- 
infinitive | att tala | to speak
present tense | du talar | you speak, you are speaking

- All Swedish verbs in the infinitive end in `-a` or in another vowel.
- Most Swedish verbs in the present tense end in `-r`. 
```
jag talar svenska
Herr Berg förstår mig
en kopp kaffe kostar en krona
```

Present tense is used to express an action that 
- is happening now (Jag äter nu - I'm eating now)
- happens repeatedly (jag äter smörgasar till lunch - I eat sandwiches for lunch) and, 
- sometimes, an action in the future (han kommer imorgon - he's coming tomorrow).

Notice that Swedish does not have the equivalent of the English continuous verb form (to be + verb + -ing). Example: `I am speaking` is simply `jag talar`.
Infinitive:

Examples:
- Jag talar svenska. 
  -  I speak Swedish.
  - I'm speaking Swedish.
- Greta går tiII ambassaden.
  - Greta walks to the Embassy.
  - Greta is walking to the Embassy.

There are a few verbs that do not take -r in the present among them most auxiliaries (helping verbs):
- du `ska` tala svenska
  - you `will` speak Swedish
  - you `are going to` speak Swedish
- du `kan` förstå svenska
  - you `can` understand Swedish
  - you `are able to` understand Swedish

### Point 3 - Word Order
Simple Swedish sentences usually begin with the subject, followed by the conjugated verb.

Examples:
- Jag talar svenska. 
  -  I speak Swedish.
  - I'm speaking Swedish.
- Greta går tiII ambassaden.
  - Greta walks to the Embassy.
  - Greta is walking to the Embassy.
- En kopp kaffe kostar en krona.
  - A cup of coffee costs one crown.
- Det finns ett hotell här.
  - There is a hotel here.

In Swedish you make questions by just reversing the order of subject and verb.

- `Talar ni` svenska?
  - Do you speak Swedish?
  - Are you speaking Swedish?
- `Går Greta` till ambassaden?
  - Does greta walk to the Embassy?
  - Is Greta walking to the Embassy?
- `Kostar en kopp kaffe` en krona?
  - Does a cup of coffee cost one crown?
- `Finns det` ett hotell här?
  - Is there a hotel here?

Notice how simple Swedish is! Don't ever try to translate `do`, `does`, `did` when formulating a question in Swedish. Reversing the subject and verb is all you have to do.

## Point 4 - Auxiliaries (helping verbs)
Auxiliaries or helping verbs go together with one or more infinitives. Only the
helping verb is conjugated.

swedish | english | auxiliary
--- | --- | ---
du `ska tala` svenska | you `are going to speak` Swedish | future
du `vill hjälpa` mig | you `want to help` me | desire
du `kan förstå` svenska | you `can understand` Swedish | ability 

Notice the use of `ska` and `viII` in Swedish. `Ska` in front of an infinitive indicates future time. `Vill` indicate a wish or desire.
