Clauses may be `main` (independent) or `subordinate` (dependent).

A `main clause` is able to stand alone and constitutes a full sentence.

Example: Peter was reading the paper.

A `subordinate clause` acts like a modifier (adjective or adverb), and is linked to a main clause by a subordinating conjunction. 

Example: Peter was reading the paper `when the door bell rang`.

## Comparative

`Compound nouns` - a lexical noun phrase (i.e. a noun phrase which is considered one unit of meaning).

Examples: coat hanger, blaakboard, airplane

`Compound verbs` - a lexical verb phrase (i.e. a verb phrase which is considered one unit of meaning). 

Examples: give up, find out, give in

`Compound tenses` - a combination of an auxiliary and a main verb. See [auxiliary verb](#auxiliary-verb)
